			<h1> Welcome to the Stream Submission! </h1>
			<p> I am a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Ucx0irV_kUP6Eqkvz3u0Q">YouTuber</a> with a small following looking to create a musical radio station. <br>
			I currently cannot guarantee a lot of exposure, or if this stream will be 24/7 or on a scheduled basis. <br>
			I am familiar with making multiple streams of this kind, but this is the first time I am making something to this scale. <br>
			I'm only one person doing this, and due to this it will take me awhile to set this all up. </p>
			<p> Due to how small my channel is, I CANNOT GUARANTEE MONETIZATION OF ANY KIND FOR ANY OF YOUR TRACKS SUBMITTED!!! </p>
		</div>
		<div class="guidelines">
			<h1> Guidelines </h1>
			<p> If you still want to submit your track despite these harsh conditions, the guidelines are below~ <br><br>

			I will review every track that is submitted and contact you if I like the track. 
			This part is obviously very subjective. You could send a beautifully mastered track but I simply don't like because the BPM is too fast. 
			Likewise, the song could be very repetitive with only one notable sample, and I might just feature that track first in the stream. <br><br> 
			
			I will only be accepting ONE track from each individual/group. This is to make it fair for other people submitting their tracks </p>
			<p> 1. All samples in your track must be cleared beforehand. Obviously this doesnt apply if your track: </p>
			<p> Consists mostly of YOUR instrumentals </p>
			<p> Consists mostly of YOUR vocals </p>
				<p> 2. If your track is part of a collective/record label, please provide contact information. </p>
				<p> 3. Send a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">WAV</a> file. If that is not possible, explain why and send another format. Please click the links if you need more information. </p>
			<p> If you think your stream meets the requirements, contact me here: <br>
			<h1>steamingtracks@gmail.com</h1> </p>
			<p> Thank you for your interest. </p>
