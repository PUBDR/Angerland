                    stream will be 24/7 or on a scheduled basis. <br> I am familiar with making multiple streams of this kind, but this is the first time I am making something to this scale. <br> I'm only one person doing this, and due to this it will
                    take me awhile to set this all up.

                <h3> Guidelines </h3>
                <p> If you still want to submit your track despite these harsh conditions, the guidelines are below~ <br><br> I will review every track that is submitted and contact you if I like the track. This part is obviously very subjective. You could
                    send a beautifully mastered track but I simply don't like because the BPM is too fast. Likewise, the song could be very repetitive with only one notable sample, and I might just feature that track first in the stream. <br><br> I will
                    only be accepting ONE track from each individual/group. This is to make it fair for other people submitting their tracks </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> All samples in your track must be cleared beforehand. Obviously this doesnt apply if your track: </p>
                        Consists mostly of YOUR instrumentals Consists mostly of YOUR vocals </li>
                    <li> If your track is part of a collective/record label, please provide contact information. </li>
                    <li> Send a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">WAV</a> file. If that is not possible, explain why and send another format. Please click the links if you need more information.
                    </li>
